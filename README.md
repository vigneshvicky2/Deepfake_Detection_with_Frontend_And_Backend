# Deepfake Detection Project 🎥🔍

Welcome to the Deepfake Detection Project! This project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to identify deepfake videos and images. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and start detecting deepfakes. 🚀

## 📚 What is Deepfake Detection?

Deepfake detection involves identifying manipulated media, such as videos and images, where artificial intelligence has been used to alter the content. This project leverages machine learning models to differentiate between authentic and deepfake content. It's essential in combating misinformation and maintaining the integrity of digital media.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

### 1. Download Python 3.10.7 🐍

Ensure Python 3.10.7 is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/).

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment 🌟

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment 💻

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Required Packages 📦

Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Model Paths 🗂️

You need to specify the paths to your pre-trained models in `main.py`. Open `main.py` and update the following lines with your model paths:

```python
# Path to the video model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(r"C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\project\Deepfake detection-Final\Video_models")

# Path to the image model
model_dir = r'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\project\Deepfake detection-Final\image_models'
```

Make sure these paths point to your actual model directories.

### 6. Run the Application 🚀

Launch the application with:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will start and be ready for deepfake detection!

## 📂 Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main script to run the application.
- `main.py`: Contains the core deepfake detection logic.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

If you face any issues:
- Verify Python 3.10.7 is installed.
- Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
- Double-check the model paths in `main.py`.

For further assistance, feel free to open an issue! 😄

## 📖 Detailed Explanation of Deepfake Detection

Deepfake detection uses machine learning models to analyze videos and images for signs of manipulation. The models are trained on large datasets containing both real and manipulated media. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect a diverse set of real and deepfake media for training.
2. **Model Training**: Train models to recognize subtle differences between authentic and manipulated content.
3. **Detection**: Use the trained models to analyze new media and predict if it is a deepfake.

By following these steps, you can help identify manipulated content and contribute to a more trustworthy digital environment.
