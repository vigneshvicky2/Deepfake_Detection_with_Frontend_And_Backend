        <h1>Welcome to Deepfake Detection</h1>
        <p>
            Our deepfake detection system is designed to identify manipulated media, ensuring the integrity of digital content. By utilizing advanced deep learning models, we can detect if a video or image has been altered or generated by AI, helping to combat the spread of misinformation and malicious content.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system works by analyzing media through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on real and fake datasets. It detects subtle inconsistencies in the media that are invisible to the human eye, offering a high level of accuracy in identifying deepfakes. Our goal is to ensure the trustworthiness of content shared across platforms, providing users with a tool to verify the authenticity of the media they encounter.
